                <p>She basically toys with the humans. She’s an immortal being that created the land of alitia and enjoys watching strong bloodlines massacre themselves. She’s evil despite appearances.
                    People believe what they want, some think she's a false god, some think she's the god of everything
                    Some believe she's just a god that reigns over life and death
                    and some don't believe in her existence whatsoever
                    Legend says those who visit reverie lose all their memories except from a chosen few, those are the people that’ll keep some skills</p>

                <h1>Magic & The Priestess Astra (Year 297)</h1>
                <p>There was once an elven girl named Astra (15 years old) 
                who lived with her parents, brother, and sister Hestia (12 years old)
                in the land of Efolona. She had everything she ever wanted, love, friendship,
                family, and was known by everyone in her village. She loved to read and enjoyed
                sharing stories with both her closest friends and siblings. 
                One day out of the blue, a human army from an unknown land
                was sent by a higher-order to take over the land of Efolona. 
                What followed next was endless bloodshed; Elven warriors riding 
                their hounds with swords and bows and arrows defending their land 
                human warriors attacking with their swords, maces, horses,
                and armour. Their motive behind the attack was unknown as
                whenever a warrior was taken prisoner and interrogated, they would
                refuse to cooperate, many of which ended their own lives (committed suicide) 
                with the various tools at their disposal (Poisonous tooth pill, cliff jumping, 
                smashing their head against prison cells, etc). These warriors were clearly 
                extremely loyal to whoever sent them. During this unprecedented war, villages were 
                told to flee to the capitol where they’d be protected by the elven heroes there. 
                On the way to the capitol, the party from Astra’s village was ambushed by a group 
                of warriors. Many of them losing their lives trying to fend them off, including 
                Astra’s older brother, her father, and her mother, leaving a few village folks, 
                her older sister, best friend, and boyfriend left. They were taken prisoner by 
                the Human army and were interrogated being asked to reveal information on how to 
                take down the capitol. As none of them had ever been to the capitol, they were 
                deemed disposable by the interrogators who executed the remaining villagers one 
                by one in the cells they were being held captive. Eventually, they get on to Astra’s 
                boyfriend who she begs them to stop for. The soldiers laugh and then put a spear 
                through his chest which traumatises her, they then get on to her sister to humour 
                Astra even more who Astra now completely silent stares in trauma. The guards mocking 
                her more put a blade to her sister’s throat who is screaming and crying. Astra let out 
                a faint “Stop… this” as the guards laugh more about her trying to prevent the inevitable. 
                They raise the blade asking Hestia if she has any last wishes they don’t care for. 
                Astra quietly says “Please… I can’t lose her too” which the guards happily mock. 
                They swing the blade to end Hestia’s life in which Astra responds yelling “I SAID STOP”. 
                As the blade touches Hestia’s neck, a massive surge of energy is released from Astra which 
                causes the guards to freeze in their places. One guard yells “What the hell was that?!” 
                And one by one they start hitting the floor screaming in agony. Hestia then unconsciously 
                blows them away through the walls of the building and frees her sister from her chains not 
                saying a word, clearly lost in the power. She then heads to the front line of the battlefield 
                and annihilates the invading army with meteors, bottomless pits, portals that suck the humans 
                into another world, and many more magical phenomenons. Nothing is known about what happened to 
                the humans who got sucked through the portals.

                Astra was then titled the Priestess of Magic and saviour of Efolona.

                This interaction caused the Elven race to despise the Human race despite many humans not knowing of the existence of the army.

                Astra not knowing how to control her power noticed that she could share a portion of it with 
                anyone she touched. (Eventually, everyone figured out that if a spell was used on someone, 
                they’d unlock the ability to use magic due to some “unlocking gene”) The capitol leaders used 
                this to ability to increase their attack and defences immensely by giving all elves power. 
                Some elves went corrupt with the power, some became heroes of their own stories, and the rest 
                just went about their every day normal lives with magic now as a tool at their disposal.</p>
