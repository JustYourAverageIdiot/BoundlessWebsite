                <p>She basically toys with the humans. She’s an immortal being that created 
                the land of alitia and enjoys watching strong bloodlines massacre themselves. 
                She’s evil despite appearances.
                People believe what they want, some think she's a false god, some think she's the god of everything
                Some believe she's just a god that reigns over life and death
                and some don't believe in her existence whatsoever
                Legend says those who visit reverie lose all their memories except from a chosen few, 
                those are the people that’ll keep some skills</p>

                <h1>Magic & The Priestess Astra (Year 297)</h1>
                <p>There was once an elven girl named Astra (15 years old) 
                who lived with her parents, brother, and sister Hestia (12 years old)
                in the land of Efolona. She had everything she ever wanted, love, friendship,
                family, and was known by everyone in her village. She loved to read and enjoyed
                sharing stories with both her closest friends and siblings. 
                One day out of the blue, a human army from an unknown land
                was sent by a higher-order to take over the land of Efolona. 
                What followed next was endless bloodshed; Elven warriors riding 
                their hounds with swords and bows and arrows defending their land 
                human warriors attacking with their swords, maces, horses,
                and armour. Their motive behind the attack was unknown as
                whenever a warrior was taken prisoner and interrogated, they would
                refuse to cooperate, many of which ended their own lives (committed suicide) 
                with the various tools at their disposal (Poisonous tooth pill, cliff jumping, 
                smashing their head against prison cells, etc). These warriors were clearly 
                extremely loyal to whoever sent them. During this unprecedented war, villages were 
                told to flee to the capitol where they’d be protected by the elven heroes there. 
                On the way to the capitol, the party from Astra’s village was ambushed by a group 
                of warriors. Many of them losing their lives trying to fend them off, including 
                Astra’s older brother, her father, and her mother, leaving a few village folks, 
                her older sister, best friend, and boyfriend left. They were taken prisoner by 
                the Human army and were interrogated being asked to reveal information on how to 
                take down the capitol. As none of them had ever been to the capitol, they were 
                deemed disposable by the interrogators who executed the remaining villagers one 
                by one in the cells they were being held captive. Eventually, they get on to Astra’s 
                boyfriend who she begs them to stop for. The soldiers laugh and then put a spear 
                through his chest which traumatises her, they then get on to her sister to humour 
                Astra even more who Astra now completely silent stares in trauma. The guards mocking 
                her more put a blade to her sister’s throat who is screaming and crying. Astra let out 
                a faint “Stop… this” as the guards laugh more about her trying to prevent the inevitable. 
                They raise the blade asking Hestia if she has any last wishes they don’t care for. 
                Astra quietly says “Please… I can’t lose her too” which the guards happily mock. 
                They swing the blade to end Hestia’s life in which Astra responds yelling “I SAID STOP”. 
                As the blade touches Hestia’s neck, a massive surge of energy is released from Astra which 
                causes the guards to freeze in their places. One guard yells “What the hell was that?!” 
                And one by one they start hitting the floor screaming in agony. Hestia then unconsciously 
                blows them away through the walls of the building and frees her sister from her chains not 
                saying a word, clearly lost in the power. She then heads to the front line of the battlefield 
                and annihilates the invading army with meteors, bottomless pits, portals that suck the humans 
                into another world, and many more magical phenomenons. Nothing is known about what happened to 
                the humans who got sucked through the portals.
                Astra was then titled the Priestess of Magic and saviour of Efolona.
                This interaction caused the Elven race to despise the Human race despite many humans not knowing of the existence of the army.
                Astra not knowing how to control her power noticed that she could share a portion of it with 
                anyone she touched. (Eventually, everyone figured out that if a spell was used on someone, 
                they’d unlock the ability to use magic due to some “unlocking gene”) The capitol leaders used 
                this to ability to increase their attack and defences immensely by giving all elves power. 
                Some elves went corrupt with the power, some became heroes of their own stories, and the rest 
                just went about their every day normal lives with magic now as a tool at their disposal. After 
                Astra had shared her newfound power with the rest of the region, she requested to leave the region, 
                unguarded, in order to “mourn her friends, family’s, and boyfriend’s death” leaving Hestia in the 
                capitol alone surrounded by strangers. Her true intentions were to use her newfound abilities to 
                wipe out the Human race, however, she had to spend 3 years learning how to use and control her powers. </p>

              <h1>The Dark War & The Priestess / Witch of Death (Year 300)</h1>
              <p>Astra wasn’t seen until the year 300 where she began attacking 
              Human empires and leaving them in ruins. She would always spare 
              the children but as they no longer had parents or anybody to look 
              after them, most perished. She was titled the Witch of Death by 
              the Humans and word of her slaughters were passed between various 
              regions throughout the world. The Humans asked other regions to 
              help in the war against the priestess however none other than 
              close Human ruled empires came to her aid. The ones that were far 
              from the frontlines decided to hang back as they felt if they 
              remained inconspicuous, the priestess wouldn’t notice them. This 
              wasn’t the case as they were eventually eradicated as well.</p>

                <h1>The Goddess Hestia, The Witch of Death, and The Sea (Year 307) (The main lore)</h1>
                <p>Hestia decided she wanted to leave the land of Efolona with a handful of guards from 
                the capitol to teach the world about the wonders of magic. She had never seen other regions 
                before, only read about them in storybooks, but every land and region she had visited around 
                Efolona was nothing like the brilliant places her fairytales made them out to be, they were 
                all in ruins. Corpses left scattered across the lands, and terrain that had been destroyed 
                by some unknown entity. After months of exploring and trying to understand what happened to 
                these places and why they were so different to what she dreamed, Hestia and her few guards 
                found themselves in a ruined street where they were in the process of deciding to end their 
                journey and return back to Efolona. This is the moment a Human man (Elyan), 22 years in age, 
                ran out of a beat-up shop with a poorly made iron sword and charged right for Hestia. One of 
                her guards immediately took action and disarmed Elyan with the swift movement of his hand and 
                the force of powerful wind that followed. The young man, Elyan stood still as if he was frozen 
                completely solid and stared anxiously towards Hestia. Hestia looked towards the man and asked 
                him a simple question, “why are your eyes full of hate for an elf you’ve never met before?” 
                Silent, still, and question unanswered, tension builds even more. “I’LL KILL YOU!” Elyan screeches 
                before forcing himself towards Hestia with his bare hands.</p>

                <h1>Unnamed Kingdom (Year 870)</h1>
                <p>In a once beautiful kingdom, the princess of the land was adored by many. She was greatly 
                fascinated by the wonders of the magic that made the world feel special. Fire spells, healing 
                spells, party spells, they were all amazing to her. A corrupt prince had tried the princesses’ 
                hand in marriage many times with the king of the land refusing. After his untimely death and due 
                to having no sons, the princess was appointed the next ruler of the kingdom. The Queen ruled with 
                great just for a decade whilst year after year, the prince would come to the land and ask for the 
                Queen’s hand in marriage. The Queen declined every time until she eventually called him a disgrace 
                to his kingdom and a disgusting prince. This angered the prince who, once becoming king, decided 
                to march an army on the queen’s kingdom. After visiting the land so many times he knew the best 
                places the army could enter the kingdom suffering minimal casualties. The Queen’s land wasn’t 
                prepared for the unexpected assault and their best defenders were wiped out in a day, however, she 
                was able to escape the land by sea with the help of a few of her loyal subjects. Nobody knows where 
                she is now. The prince became the king of the land and ruled as a dictator, and all the Queens 
                followers were executed if they had proved to be loyal to her. The prince believed that the queen 
                had rejected his hand in marriage due to the fact that he didn’t know any magic. As a result, the 
                prince, new king, deemed the possession of magic high treason, punishable by death. As the king 
                controls two kingdoms, his followers from kingdom one are allowed to come and go as they please 
                however the followers from kingdom two have to request permission from him himself which he can 
                choose to accept or deny whenever he feels like it. His followers from kingdom one love and support 
                the way he rules with an iron fist. Some of his followers (although most wish they weren't) from 
                kingdom two were plotting a coup before a spy figured it out telling the king who then proceeded 
                to wipe out half of kingdom two’s population (that came from the queen). Kingdom two’s followers 
                have not only lost their loved ones and all hope, they resent the king and are desperately hoping 
                for their true ruler. </p>

                <h1>The School Of Magic & The First Magia (Year 578)</h1>
                <p>Elves were the strongest magic users so they made the school of magic as a sign of peace with all races
                Many elves disagreed and still resent Humans even though they never experienced the war. Bejitarians were 
                the first to attend with one bejitarian dedicating so much of his time into it that he created the first 
                magia. He tried to make his magic stronger by pouring his own life force into his spells. He backfired 
                horribly on his first attempt, and as a result his magic took on a sentient form that somehow was much 
                more powerful than the sorcerer himself. This new being composed of pure mana has the ability to wield 
                it as if it were as easy as breathing, and had a slight resistance to magic spells.</p>

                <h1>Magia Immigrants</h1>
                <p>The School Of Magic was home to many magia’s. Despite this many sought a different lifestyle. 
                Many magia’s left the school of magic to travel the Boundless world. After years of traveling and 
                many dying during the process, they arrived at a very interesting island. This island held unique 
                hues of plants never before seen, and just as many plants already seen but much bigger than their 
                normal counterparts. Upon investigating and finding a fruit appearing to look like an apple, this 
                fruit was glowing and radiating strong energy. You could feel its power if you held it, but it 
                wasn’t “power” in a sense.. It felt calm.. Natural.. This island, somehow was taking in the mana 
                around the world and using it to help all life on it prosper. Birds were infused with mana, flying 
                at blisting speeds, mushrooms emitting a bright light from their spots, and even the grass which 
                is known to be a vibrant green now boasted a blue hue, and felt like soft fur when you touched it. 
                After generations of living on this new island, some magia’s started an organization to help protect 
                their citizens and all inhabitants of the island. This organization was called the White Clover, and 
                it’s full of powerful mages that are one with the life energy of Mana and serve to protect all life 
                precious in the world.</p>
