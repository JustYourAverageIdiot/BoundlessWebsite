                <h1>General info</h1>
                <p>Boundless is a rogue-like rpg game being crated by Playful studios. 
                It uses a permadeath mechanic and revolves mostly anround PVE and exploration, 
                however there is also PVP. You are dropped in an open world without a thing and 
                you need to progress by doing quest, getting exp, killing monsters, aquiring skills 
                and maybe even killing other people. You spawn with a random race that has it's own 
                special abilities and you need to survive and try not to get killed, otherwise you'll 
                have to start over from scratch.</p>
